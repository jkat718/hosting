# Welcome

In this open-ended campaign, I intend to foster a relaxing yet rewarding play experience that will help each of us destress from our hectic lives. Please bring to the table a desire to enjoy one another's company, a willingness to be flexible, and an engaged mind ready to spend a few hours each week exploring a fantastical land with your friends.

> **Time:** Fridays, 6pm–9pm EST (end time flexible)
>
> **Platform:** Roll20, possibly with Discord
>
> **Theme:** High fantasy dungeon delves with a splash of politics

I'm looking forward to joining you all at the table!

# Group Dynamics

**Calming Space.** I am available to help resolve any conflicts, either at or away from the table, that are affecting the game. If your conflict is with me, please let me know and I will make whatever changes are needed. If you ever need a break during a session, let me know and I'll find a good stopping point ASAP. No reason needed, no questions asked.

**Joint Endeavour.** If we're missing half the group, give or take a player, we will either cancel or—if the story allows—run a shortened and/or less plot-critical session. These sessions will allow for more in-depth downtime, connecting with the setting, or pursuing personal sidequests. Because of this, do not feel obligated to attend if you are not in the correct mental space, as the rest of the group may still be able to progress in your absence.

**Safety Mechanisms.** Beyond the above guidelines, I will be utilizing two safety tools, both taken from [Golden Lasso Games](http://goldenlassogames.com/tools). The first of these is **Lines & Veils**. Lines are hard limits, discussed either as a group or in private with myself, that everyone in the group must respect. Veils, on the other hand, are topics that may be part of the story, but will strictly occur "off-screen" (think a classic fade-to-black or convenient pan-away). You may introduce or revoke either a Line or Veil at any time. The second safety tool is **Script Changes**, wherein anyone, at any point, may call for a Rewind, Pause, or Fast Forward if they feel uncomfortable in a situation. Rewinds will back up to before the conflict point, and resolve matters in such a way as to avoid them. Pauses are just that, short breathers to make sure everyone's on the same page. And Fast Forwards, similarly to Veils, will skip ahead to after the conflict point. While I do not intend to have much (if any!) controversial content in my games, I want to establish well ahead of time that your emotional safety is paramount, and any usage of these safety mechanisms is entirely acceptable.

**Group Membership.** New players will be admitted by majority vote of all participants, with a trial session if deemed necessary. If any player wishes to leave the campaign, they are free to do so, though I encourage you to attempt to resolve any conflicts well before reaching this point. If you are having trouble sharing a table with another member of the group, please let me know and I will try to reach an amenable solution.

# Gameplay

I try to keep combat fast-paced, but not stressful. You are free to relish the spotlight when it is on you, but please be mindful of the time you take on your turns as compared to your party members, and let others enjoy their own time to shine. And remember, the more time you take to figure out what you want to do, the more time *I* have to plot on your enemy's behalf. ;)

I have a few table rules that help speed up combat and promote meaningful actions:

- Roll dice in chat or on the table whenever possible, and don't bother redoing rolls if you forgot a modifier (just adjust whatever result you got). Same goes for (dis)advantage, just use the first roll / roll a straight d20.
- By default, information gained by individuals is assumed to be shared with the party as soon as the individual has the ability to communicate with them, although you can declare otherwise.
- I will be using a handful of variant and optional rules to cut down on unnecessary dice rolls, and just using things like automatic success and passive scores to speed things up.
- Any rules debates will be hard-stopped at 5 minutes, after which a ruling will be made that will stand (regardless of accuracy!) until is reasonably fair to take some time and correct.
- Players may be asked to handle NPCs for me in combat, just let me know if you're interested.
- Determine/referencing enemy stats to speed up gameplay and cut down on back-and-forth number comparison is fine, but please modify what information you act on by what your character would reasonably know.
- In-character dialogue can be retroactively declared non-canon, but please do so sparingly, as it slows down gameplay (and it's difficult for me to keep track of).

## Inspiration

Inspiration will (hopefully) be much more common than usual. Players may willingly accept disadvantage on an important roll in exchange for Inspiration at a future time (they can request it or the DM may offer it). Players may bargain for advantage in exchange for the DM gaining Inspiration for any enemy NPC. They may even grant the DM Inspiration for a particularly well-run session, though this kind of Inspiration may only be used by the DM to further the plot in some way. You may have more than one point of Inspiration at a time, though certain applications of Inspiration may require multiple.

- When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you may immediately perform a Dying Action. This can be a prayer to your god, a soliloquy, a dying wish, whatever. Good time to get Inspiration or guilt your friends.
- If you are reduced to 0 hit points, you may expend Inspiration to instead drop to 1 hit point and gain either a Lingering Injury or a form of Indefinite Madness of the DM's choice. You may use your Dying Action to gain this Inspiration.

# Character Creation

All officially-published content is fine, as well as any homebrew I locate/create for you (though everything may be subject to balancing tweaks if it gets unfun). If you want a custom race, subrace, background, equipment, etc., just let me know in advance and we can work something out.

## Races

### Changes to Humans

Humans now get a floating +2 and three +1s to stats instead of their existing Ability Score Increase, as well as a skill or tool proficiency of their choice. Variant Human is not available.

### Changes to Dragonborn

The first line of Dragonborn's Breath Weapon now reads "When you take the Attack action on your turn, you may forgo one attack to exhale destructive energy."

## Ability Scores & Starting Feat

We'll be doing 27 point buy with an expanded range (see below), but do try not to min-max *too* hard. Everyone also starts with a Feat of your choice.

| Ability score | Point Buy Cost | Modifier |
| ------------- | -------------- | -------- |
| 17            | 16             | +3       |
| 16            | 12             | +3       |
| 15            | 9              | +2       |
| 14            | 7              | +2       |
| 13            | 5              | +1       |
| 12            | 4              | +1       |
| 11            | 3              | +0       |
| 10            | 2              | +0       |
| 9             | 1              | -1       |
| 8             | 0              | -1       |
| 7             | -1             | -2       |
| 6             | -2             | -2       |

## Backgrounds & Backstory

Custom backgrounds are fine, as are all variant backgrounds. Feel free to use the "This is Your Life" section in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything* to generate/inspire your backstory, but don't feel beholden to dice rolls (you can pick any result instead of rolling for it, if you want). Please select 2 traits, 1 ideal, 1 bond, and 1 flaw. You may select from any background (not just your own), or you may write something yourself. You should also select a deity or pantheon, if your character is religious. At a minimum, your backstory should cover who your family is/was, where you were raised, and why you became an adventurer. I will be reading your backstories and drawing on them to connect your characters to the world, give me something interesting to use!

## Starting Equipment

Take the starting equipment from your class and background (and anything you might've gotten from the *Xanathar's* random background), rather than a la cart. Use the Starting Equipment table below to determine how much wealth you have. Additionally, everyone starts with a trinket. Roll for it, pick one, or make up your own.

| Starting Level |                          Equipment                           |               Magic Items                |
| :------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|    1st–4th     |                  Normal starting equipment                   |                   -\-                    |
|    5th–10th    |   500 gp plus 1d10 x 25 gp,<br />normal starting equipment   |                1 uncommon                |
|   11th-16th    | 5,000 gp plus 1d10 x 250 gp,<br />normal starting equipment  |        3 uncommon<br />and 1 rare        |
|   17th-20th    | 20,000 gp plus 1d10 x 250 gp,<br />normal starting equipment | 3 uncommon, 2 rare,<br />and 1 very rare |

If the table indicates you get 1 item of a given rarity, you may instead choose to take 2 consumable magic items of an equal rarity. If you get 2 items of a given rarity, you may take 3 consumables. If you get 3 items of a given rarity, you may either take 5 consumables OR you may take take 3 non-consumables and 1 consumable.

# Combat & Adventuring

In addition to drawing inspiration from many of the optional and variant rules for combat and adventuring in the *Dungeon Master's Guide* or simply using them directly, I have a handful of other miscellaneous rules that I use to keep the game interesting and dynamic.

## Using Your Abilities

- Passive ability scores are calculated with *8*+proficiency+ability modifier, rather than the regular 10. However, any ability check you make outside of combat cannot be lower than this number. I will be using your passive scores often, in order to avoid rolling for you in secret. Information-gathering rolls may be made behind the screen more often, but I will usually defer to either Automatic Success or have you roll for it yourself. Characters are not assumed to know if they rolled low or high unless otherwise stated.
- Successfully taking the Help action may require passing a related skill check. If multiple people take the Help action, they roll with disadvantage. If 3 or more people take the Help action and at least half of them fail, the player being Helped instead rolls with disadvantage. This is to discourage "conga lines" of skill attempts. Additionally, only one person may attempt a given skill check unless circumstances or technique are significantly altered.

## Combat Mechanics

- For critical hits, the first set of damage dice is maximized.
- Initiative ties are broken by the higher initiative modifier, with an Initiative contest (or contests, if needed) to determine additional ties. The same goes for multiple Reactions occurring simultaneously.
- If retrieving an item is not covered by your free object interactions, you may do so as a Bonus Action. However, doing so may incur Opportunity Attacks. The Thief's Fast Hands feature prevents OAs.
- Abilities which summon/conjure creatures may–story allowing–summon or conjure the same exact creature each time. This allows characters to form a connection with the creatures that they command.
- Using the bonuses I use to determine creatures' ability scores, proficiencies, etc. is fine, I assume your characters are capable of some level of combat analysis. Looking up stat blocks is fine, but please modify what information you act on by what your character would reasonably know. If you're uncertain of what is/is not common knowledge, ask. I reserve the right to tweak stat blocks or roll in secret, either for balance or plot reasons, though I will try to do so sparingly.

## Variant Combat Rules

- We'll play with Flanking (as long as it doesn't get out of hand), Hitting Cover, Morale, Injuries, and loose interpretations of Facing, Cleaving Through Creatures, and Massive Damage.
- Of the various alternate technology levels detailed on DMG 267, Renaissance-era Explosives exist and are purchasable, while Firearms and Alien Technology may exist, but not for purchase.
- Of the various Action Options detailed on DMG 271, Disarm, Overrun, Shove Aside, and Tumble are all available. Climb onto a Bigger Creature may be applicable in certain scenarios.

## Conditions

- Any creature that is grappled by a creature no more than two size categories larger than it may attempt to move after winning an Athletics contest vs the other creature, but only at half speed.
- A grappled or restrained creature may be impaired in their ability to cast spells with somatic and material components.
- Willing movement by the grappler, forced movement by either creature that does not also affect the other creature, and another creature taking the Help action to assist the grappled party are all times when escape may be attempted as a reaction instead. Teleportation or similar effects will usually end a grapple automatically.
- Standing up from Prone may be done at 1/2 cost, but will provoke Opportunity Attacks from all creatures whose reach you are within. The Disengage action will still prevent these Opportunity Attacks.
- The Poisoned condition may require players to succeed Concentration checks in order to successfully cast spells, depending on source.

# Overview of Classes

For all classes, levels may only be gained at the end of a Downtime period, though I may occasionally allow have you level up at the end of a Long Rest instead, as the story allows. We will most likely use milestone XP of some sort, so this is unlikely to come into play. All classes gain a bonus skill to start, as indicated by the table below. If the skill you select is on the list of skills normally available to your class, ignore it.

|   Class   |          Skill          |
| :-------: | :---------------------: |
| Barbarian |            †            |
|   Bard    |       Performance       |
|  Cleric   |        Religion         |
|   Druid   |         Nature          |
|  Fighter  | Athletics or Acrobatics |
|   Monk    | Athletics or Acrobatics |
|  Paladin  |        Religion         |
|  Ranger   |            †            |
|   Rogue   |            †            |
| Sorcerer  |            †            |
|  Warlock  |       Persuasion        |
|  Wizard   |         Arcana          |

† indicates you pick 1 extra skill from your class' starting list.

## Alignment

While 5e does not have any alignment restrictions and I do not intend on changing that, certain classes do lend themselves towards particular alignments, which I have listed below. While I recommend you keep to the suggestions below, they are absolutely not required by any means, and deviations will not be penalized.

|  Class  |  Moral  | Social  |
| :-----: | :-----: | :-----: |
| Cleric  |    †    |    †    |
|  Druid  | Neutral | Neutral |
| Paladin | Lawful  |    †    |
| Warlock |    †    |    †    |

† indicates I recommend staying within 1 step of your deity or patron's alignment.

## Cantrips

Magic suffuses those who use it regularly, allowing for displays of divine, natural, or arcane power without thought or effort. Accordingly, if your class or subclass grants you the ability to pick spells from certain spell lists, you may choose to learn a relevant cantrip. If that spell list is the Cleric or Paladin spell lists, you may learn Thaumaturgy. the Druid or Ranger spell lists allow you to learn Druidcraft, and all other lists allow you to learn Prestidigitation. If you have a limited number of Cantrips Known, these cantrips do not count towards that limit. If you have a question which cantrips you might know, let me know and we'll figure it out. I play fast and loose with these three cantrips and they are not restricted to their listed effects, so use those more as what you'd call guidelines than actual rules.

## Multiclassing

Multiclassing is allowed, but requires an in-character justification. For example, if you want to multiclass into a new class during play, you may be required to seek out someone who can teach you the class. Multiclasses from before the game starts just need an explanation in your backstory, but do need to be approved. Multiclassing with 3 classes is discouraged, 4+ is not allowed. If you find this rule is restricting your ability to play your character to the fullest, let me know and we can work something out.

# Changes to Classes

I have made a handful of tweaks to certain classes, whether to adjust power dynamics or purely for thematics. Any changes made here are subject to rebalance if needed, but I will try not to alter anything core to your character once you've made your selections. If you feel like you or another player is not keeping up with the rest of the party or vice versa, we can always adjust as needed.

## Barbarian

- Rage Damage applies to all Strength-based weapon attacks, not just melee weapon attacks.
- Danger Sense may not be used in Heavy Armor unless you are Proficient.

### Berserker

- The first time you end a Frenzy after completing a Short or Long Rest, you do not gain a level of Exhaustion.

## Druid

- Replace Reincarnate with Raise Dead on your spell list.
- Druids may acquire non-metal variants of Medium armor/shields.
- Druids retain their mental ability scores when in Wild Shape, but gain a temporary bonus (or penalty) to each of their ability scores equal to the relevant ability modifiers for their Wild Shape form. (Don't need to calculate all of them until needed if you don't want to!)
- Druids may choose whether to revert from Wild Shape or become unconscious with they reach 0hp. If they choose to revert, they must complete a Short Rest before they choose that form again.

## Fighter

- The extra action granted from Action Surge may not be Cast a Spell.

### Eldritch Knight

- You may use your bonded weapon as an arcane focus.

## Monk

- Monk Weapons and Unarmed Strikes may be treated as having the Finesse property, depending on application (check with me first if you're planning on basing a build around this).

## Paladin

- Divine Smite is now 1d8+1d8 per spell level you have, and may be used twice per Short Rest. This increases to 3 times per Short Rest at 9th level, and four times per Short Rest at 19th level.
- If you use Cleansing Touch as an action on your turn, you may use a bonus action to also affect that target with Lay On Hands.

## Ranger

- You gain advantage on attack rolls and contests versus your Favored Enemies, as does your animal companion

## Sorcerer

- When you gain a level in this class, you can choose a Metamagics you know and replace it with another.
- With Careful Spell, you may use 3 sorcery points to ignore targets rather than have them auto pass the save.
- Twinned Spell can work on spells which have the ability to target multiple creatures but are cast on only one.

### Wild Magic

- Wild Magic Surge: Roll your own d20 (I will forget). Additionally, you may expend 1 sorcery point to give (dis)advantage to the d20 roll.

## Warlock

- You may expend a Mystic Arcanum in order to up-cast a Known Spell.
- Eldritch Master instead reads: "If you roll initiative and have no warlock spell slots remaining from your pact magic class feature, you regain 1 spell slot."
- Invocations which improve Eldritch Blast may only affect a single target, depending on the specific Invocation.

## Wizard

- You may destroy a page of your spellbook in order to use it as a Spell Scroll, but you lose the spell and must expend materials and study in order to regain it.
