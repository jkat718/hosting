# GENERAL DOCUMENT

- ## Layout/Ordering/Presentation for the Document Text

  - Two versions, "classic" and "print-friendly"
    - Print-friendly is designed first, has no pictures or decorative elements
      - Everything is organized for ease of reference, in bulleted lists, subheadings, etc. See rulesets for SCA, Dagorhir, Belegarth, Hearthlight, etc.
      - This enables easy citations (e.g., "see section A.1 under 'Weapon Construction'"), and also is what crossgamers from are more used to seeing
    - Classic is then built from the print-friendly, and has all the pictures and decoration we're used to
      - This gets the "look and feel" of what new-to-LARP players may be expecting–especially when coming from TTRPGs
      - Would be listed first on the website, so new players are more likely to see it first
  - Chapter order is designed for new player perspective first, since vets will just look up what they need
  - Establish and reuse archetypical players for use in examples, similar to 3.5e D&D
    - @TODO: write full chapter list
  
- ## Artwork, Diagrams, and other visuals

  - See [above](Layout/Ordering/Presentation for the Document Text) for information on layout and use.
  - Diagrams under both weapon construction and battlegame design

# INTRODUCTION

- ## What is Amtgard?

  - @TODO: revisit
  - Rework "What Can Amtgard Offer Me?" section to not just be a list of activities
    - "Pillar" system?

- ## Getting Started

  - Shouldn't need to list a reading order, just lay out the rulebook in that order
  - Include reference to [Awards & Symbols](#Awards & Symbols) in section on garb 

# AMTGARD THE ORGANIZATION

- ## CoM/Kingdoms

  - Replace with broad-strokes "organizational structure"
    - People don't need to know this unless they're starting a chapter, in which case this information will come from the Freehold Corpora

- ## Reeves

  - Either codify testing elsewhere or remove it entirely
  - Put identifiers in construction rules, use more general descriptions here

# AWARDS & SYMBOLS

- ## Non-Standardized Stuff

  - Move to end of book, both to not confuse people and to be nearer to the Awards Standards
  - Either standardize symbols and actually restrict them, or leave symbols up to individual kingdoms

- ## Technically Paragon (assume some collab with Award Standards)

  - Explicitly include nonstandard classes, and rework definition to match
  - @TODO: revisit

- ## Colour

  - @TODO: revisit

# ROLE-PLAYING IN AMTGARD

- ## /

# COMBAT RULES

- ## Hit Locations

  - Keep generally the same, but keep "holding equipment" exceptions out of definitions and under [Inflicting Wounds](#Inflicting Wounds).
  - All the various notes should be under [Inflicting Wounds](#Inflicting Wounds), specifically under that limb's section

- ## Combat Contact

  - Pretty much fine, just clean up trapping/pinning of weapons and bodies, bashing, moving bodies, etc.

- ## Inflicting Wounds

  - Break into "Shot Validity" and "Effects of Wounds" (latter being further broken down by hit location)

- ## Death (the entirely of death and it's various interactions)

  - Either include JUST the ditch/militia death rules, and have a separate section about full-class combat rules, or include ALL the death/dying/resurrect/etc rules here (prefer former)

- ## Combat Notes

  - Delete, move content to appropriate sections:
    - 1 –> Shot Validity and/or Equipment
    - 2 –> Shot Validity
    - 3 –> Equipment?
    - 4 –> Death

- ## Combat Etiquette

  - Move as much content as possible to appropriate sections
  - Make section either explicitly optional or mandatory

# ARMOR

- ## Armor Combat Rules

  - **Gap Rule:** any gap of <1.25" between pieces of armor is not considered a gap for the purposes of blocking strikes, same goes for gaps of <2.5" when worn over other armor
  - **Texanada Gambeson Rule:** at gamerunner's discretion, some sort of "if you bring the armor to field, it counts as long as you do X instead of wearing it" proxy armor system, to cover extreme cold or heat

- ## Armor Construction Rules

  - Remove all weight and material restrictions, move to [Armor Types and Modifiers](#Armor Types and Modifiers)
  - Assume gambesons are worn when required, benefits are coverage and comfort, not armor points.
  - No cap on net bonuses from modifiers, just armor category maximums
  - **Standard Materials:**
    - **Cloth:** 1/16"
    - **Leather:** 3/16" or 12oz
    - **Metal Rings:** 16ga round steel, 18ga flat steel or round aluminum, or similar
    - **Metal Plates:** 20ga steel, 18ga aluminium, or similar

- ## Armor Types and Modifiers

  - **General Modifiers:** Accesory, Inferior Appearance, Inferior Construction, Superior Appearance, Superior Construction
    - **Accessory (+1):** Wearing protective gear hands, feet, or head that matches the aesthetic of the game grants a bonus to the appropriate arm, appropriate leg, or to the torso, respectively
    - **Inferior Appearance (-1 or -2):** Armor is damaged or poorly maintaned
    - **Inferior Construction (-1 or -2):** Armor is poorly constructed or uses significantly inferior (lighter, thinner, weaker/etc.) materials compared to the standard
    - **Superior Appearance (+1):** Non-construction beautification (painting, tooling, etc.)
    - **Superior Construction (+1):** Advanced construction techniques or materials
  - **Categories:** Non-Rigid Non-Metal, Rigid Non-Metal, Non-Rigid Metal, Rigid Metal
    - **Non-Rigid Non-Metal (AKA "Cloth/Leather")**
      - **Materials:** Cloth, leather (including vinyl and pleather), or fur (including faux fur)
      - **Armor Points:** Base 1, Max 4
      - **Specific Modifier: Strong**
        - **Strong (+1):** Does not deform significantly under its own weight (via additional thickness, material reinforcement, or treatments such as waxing, lacquering, or boiling)
    - **Rigid Non-Metal (AKA "Synthetic/Exotic")**
      - **Materials:** Plastics and other non-metals that do not deform significantly over the course of combat (covers exotic materials like lacquered paper and wood)
      - **Armor Points:** Base 2, Max 6
      - **Specific Modifier: Large Plates**
        - **Large Plates (+1):** coverage is primarily provided by a few large pieces of rigid material,  rather than multiple smaller ones
    - **Non-Rigid Metal (AKA "Chain/Scale/Butted")**
      - **Materials:** Invidividual pieces of metal attached either directly or via a connective material, the whole of which deforms significantly under its own weight
      - **Armor Points:** Base 3, Max 6
    - **Rigid Metal (AKA "Lam/Brig/Plate")**
      - **Materials:** Individual pieces of metal attached either directly or via a connective material, the whole of which does not deform significantly under its own weight
      - **Armor Points:** Base 4, Max 6
      - **Specific Modifier: Large Plates**
        - **Large Plates (+1):** coverage is primarily provided by a few large pieces of metal,  rather than multiple smaller ones

# MAGIC & ABILITIES

- ## General Mechanics

  - Rely heavily on states, keywords, and other standardized mechanics
    - **Exemplar 1, Abeyance:** applies state for standard timer, ignores armor
    - **Exemplar 2, Hold Person:** applies state for standard timer
    - **Exemplar 3, Blessing Against Wounds:** applies state
    - **Antithesis 1, Sphere of Annihilation:** Magic Ball, destroys weapons but isn't Weapon Destroying, Shield Destroying, kills  but isn't Wounds Kill, Curses, ignores armor, ignores certain enchantments but isn't Phase
    - **Antithesis 2, Insult:** one-off effect, one-off end condition, weird effect transference
    - **Antithesis 3, Phoenix Tears:** respawn-but-not, multiple uses, additional enchantment "slot" with weird set of limitations and buffs

- ## Charge Mechanic

- ## Incantations

  - 

- ## Enchantments

  - Plentiful but minor. 1-2 predefined states, strongly avoid one-off effects.
    - **Exemplar 1, Barkskin:** grants Magic Armor
    - **Exemplar 2, Bear Strength:** grants Special Effect to bearer
    - **Antithesis 1, Lycanthropy:** grants Magic Armor, a Special Effect, and a State
    - **Antithesis 2, Song of Deflection:** "does not receive Wounds" but not Immune, plus the Bard song mechanic
  - No baked-in Ancestral Armor on Magic Armor
  - Martials' sustain abilities should synergize with enchantments (self-mending, charging abilities granted by worn enchantments, etc)

- ## States

- ## Special Effects

  - Keep the "one applicable SE per event" rule, it streamlines so much
